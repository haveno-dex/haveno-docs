This is because a USPMO is a bearer instrument\u2014as long as the money order itself is valid, it doesn't matter who sent it or what the sender's address is.</li> <li>Consider using an online name generator (search \"random name generator\" on your favorite search engine) for a more bias-free suggestion for the sender's name.</li> <li>For the sender's address, you may want to be more careful, because if your envelope is returned, you'll want to be able to retrieve it.</li> <li>Option 1: Use an actual fake address (search internet for \"random address generator\"). If your envelope is returned for any reason, you'll probably lose it for good.</li> <li>Option 2: Use another address.

Whereas she had (I forget the exact amounts now) maybe $200 in her drawer, the neighboring teller said she had $300 and the next Teller over said he had about $700. So, my Teller took my $1,000 money order, gave me the $200 in her drawer, printed me a new money order for the difference of $800, and sent me to see the next Teller. Then, that 2nd Teller accepted my $800 money order, gave me her $300 in her drawer, and printed me the difference of $500 as a new money order. Finally, the 3rd Teller used the $700 in his drawer to fully redeem my $500 money order. I had to hop three Tellers, one after another, paying the fee for each money order printed along the way, but I walked out of the Post Office with $1,000 cash in that one visit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"overview/payment_methods/US_Postal_Money_Order/#for-new-uspmos","title":"For new USPMOs","text":"<p>Another option is to redeem the USPMO you receive for another USPMO.
