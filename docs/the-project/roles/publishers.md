# Publishers

The publishers are the entity in the Haveno ecosystem that takes care of the "live" app and release the binaries to the public. Like every other entity in the Haveno ecosystem, they are completely independent. A summary of their tasks is:

- They release the binaries (software) to the public
- They set the initial seednodes that users will use to bootstrap the network
- They provide Monero nodes for users to connect to, to boost performances
- They will set the Motoro donation address as the receiver of the fees paid on Haveno
- They give the arbitration keys to the arbitrators appointed by [Motoro](motoro.md)

Publishers are not a particularly sensitive role, but they are the most exposed entity since they take care of releasing the binaries. They will ask to be rewarded for their role by opening Motoro proposals.
