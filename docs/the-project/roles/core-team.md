# Haveno Core Team

The Haveno Core Team is currently composed of 2 people: Woodser and ErCiccione. They take care of everything related to Haveno development and expansion.

They maintain all the Haveno repositories in [github.com/haveno-dex/](https://github.com/haveno-dex/). The core team doesn't take care of running the live network, they only work on the repositories. The binaries are released by [the publishers](publishers.md).

They are rewarded as any other entity in the Haveno ecosystem: by opening a request for funds on [Motoro](motoro.md), like all other entities in [the compartmentalized structure](the-project/overview/#the-compartmentalized-structure).
