# Motoro

Motoro, previously unofficially called "Engine", is the core of the Haveno ecosystem. Its goal is similar to that of the [Monero CCS](https://ccs.getmonero.org): collect funds and distribute them to contributors. The difference with the CCS is that the funds are not provided by generous donors, but are sent directly from Haveno. Every time a trader pays a fee, it's sent directly to Motoro's fund.
 
## Purpose and functions

The purpose of Motoro is to manage and **distribute the funds** they received from the live Haveno app. The other members of the Haveno ecosystem will open proposals to request a reward for their efforts in developing, running, or maintaining Haveno, but anyone can request funds from Motoro. Proposals from Monero developers or anybody else willing to improve Haveno or Monero will be welcome.

From the moment it's formed, Motoro will be an independent entity completely separated from any other Haveno entity. The Donation address will be public, so anyone will be able to donate to Motoro and increase its treasure.

## The Konsilio

Motoro is managed by a Collective of 5 volunteer Monero developers and community members, which form the **Konsilio**, which will receive and evaluate requests for funds by members of the Haveno and Monero ecosystems. They will act on their role anonymously and will vote on each proposal. A simple majority is requested for a proposal to be approved.

The konsilio will be composed of 5 people:

- 1 Monero Core team member.
- 1 appointed by the Haveno Core Team, that will act as a volunteer representing the Haveno Core Team in the Konsilio. The volunteer has no economical relation with either the Haveno Core Team or the Konsilio.
- 3 Monero developers or contributors.

The 5 members of the Konsilio will vote anonymously, but they will be known and respected Monero community members.

### Selection

To choose the 3 community members of the Konsilio, a pool of candidates will be offered to the community, which with a vote will decide the 3 members: the 3 people with the most votes will be selected.


## Example of a Motoro request

!!! note
    The detailed operation of Motoro is still being worked on. Details will be available on Motoro itself.

Let's make a simple example to explain how a Motoro request would work:

1. Alice wants to contribute to the development of Haveno or wants to build a Monero app and requires funds.
2. Alice will open a Motoro proposal, requesting N XMR for her work, to be distributed in 3 tranches.
3. The Konsilio will meet and evaluate the proposal. If they accept it, Alice can start working straight away and depending on the terms/milestones of her proposal, already receive an amount in XMR or receive it after development has been delivered.
4. After all the milestones have been reached and the rewards delivered, the proposal is completed.
