Buyer steps:
-Bob records himself taking the cash all the way to posting it.
-Bob writes a note saying "i'm Bob, and i'm buying 0.5 Monero from Alice on Haveno, for 2x $10 bills, and 1x $5 bill, total $25", and puts it with the cash 
-Bob puts the cash (and note) into the following layers: 
Cash -> Mylar bag cash disguise (ex: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00967K3EQ) -> tamper proof bag -> 3x envelope layers with custom markings inside each layer -> Tracking envelope
-Bob then posts the envelope at the posting office or at the mailing box
-Bob gives Alice the tracking code / link so that she can see where the envelope currently is.
-Bob declares that payment has been sent on haveno

Seller steps:
-Alice records herself taking the envelope from the mailbox to opening it.
-Alice then confirms that she has recieved payment on haveno to release payment

Arbitration scenarios:
-Both Bob and Alice submit their recordings to the Arbitrator
-If Alice tried to scam Bob, the arbitrator releases the security deposit for Bob
-If Bob tried to scam Alice, the arbitrator releases the security deposit for Alice

Associated risks:

-Package is seized / lost in the postal system
-> neither bob nor alice are at fault here, so trade is canceled?
