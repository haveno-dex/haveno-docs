# Wise

Wise (formally TransferWise) is a supported payment method.

Wise can be used in SEPA trades as well, where one peer uses SEPA and another uses Wise. This article discusses Wise-to-Wise trades, where both peers use Wise.

Wise is a web- and app-based money transfer service that supports multiple currencies. Wise to Wise payments allow users to send payment from any supported currency to any other supported currency. Payments utilize the Wise multi-currency account. This is available for users in most countries.

#### 1. Setting up a Wise Account

Set up an account. Go to Wise and register for an account. KYC will be required.

#### 2. Setting up a Wise Account in Haveno

Go to Account > Traditional Currency Accounts in Haveno and select Add New Account.

Enter the email address you have registered with Wise and the currencies you would like to make and take offers with.

#### 3.Getting your Wise account ready for trading

This section is primarily for XMR sellers using Wise.

You can set up your account on the mobile app or on the web site. Screenshots are from the website.

On the left click 'open a balance'. Choose the currency you would like to trade in and select Confirm. You can add as many currencies as you wish.

The following currencies all come with local bank details as part of your Wise account (may differ depending on locations):

- AUD
- EUR
- GBP
- NZD
- RON
- SGD

If you are selling Monero on Haveno these accounts are useful as they allow you to trade with those currencies as they give you a recipient bank account that can be used to receive funds from the Buyer of Monero

Click on recipients. This is where you set up where you want the money paid to.

Click 'Add your bank account' and enter your bank account details (these can be your own bank details, or they can be the Wise local bank account details you have created).

Once added click the down arrow next to the account and select 'make primary'. This means when someone pays you via Wise to Wise it will go into your primary bank account.

NB: You need to have a primary bank account set up for each currency you wish to receive funds to on Wise. If you do not have a payment account set up the trader might not be able to send payment to you. If they are able payment will appear in your Wise balance for this currency.

#### 4. Making payments with Wise

This section is primarily for XMR buyers using Wise. Because of the way Wise payments are implemented in the Haveno trade protocol, the only information sellers have about buyers is their email address.
Wise has a useful guide about this in their [help section](https://wise.com/help/articles/2932105/can-i-send-money-to-someone-with-only-their-email-address).

To set up a transfer to an email address, follow these steps:

- Start a transfer by clicking the Send money button
- At the recipient step, choose Someone else or Business or charity
- Untick the box next to I know their bank details
- Enter your recipientâ€™s email and full name
- Pay for the transfer as usual

You can then choose how you would like to pay. You can even pay by credit or debit card!

On the case that the payment was made with a name different from the email address (which is allowed) and could create some confusion, the receiver could verify that the name of the XMR buyer is correct by writing his email on a new payment and see if the name matches the one he received it from. **Of course do not go through resending them any funds, there is no need in order to verify the name.**
