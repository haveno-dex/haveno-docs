# Payment methods

Haveno offers several payment methods to buy and sell Monero for fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies.

Every offer on Haveno designates a payment method for traders to settle payments. The Haveno software does not actually integrate with any payment methods—**all non-monero fund transfers are made outside of Haveno software.**

Unlike cryptocurrency transfers, many fiat payment transfers are riddled with flaws and limitations that require Haveno to employ special measures to encourage fair and honest trades. One of these measures is lower per-trade limits, which are covered below. Another key measure is [account signing](../account_limits.md/#account-signing).

## 1. Fiat payment methods

The payment methods vary in chargeback risk, regional availability, transaction size, fees, privacy, verifiability, and other characteristics. The top consideration for maintaining payment methods is chargeback risk.

!!! warning
   Chargebacks for payments made with PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App are relatively easy. These payment methods were introduced solely due to user demand. Using these payment methods is **not** recommended.

We welcome suggestions for new payment methods on Haveno, especially for those that enable new markets. Documentation on the criteria and process for adding new payment methods is found [here](https://github.com/haveno-dex/listing). Please also feel free to make suggestions by reaching out on Matrix room **Haveno Development** [#haveno-development:monero.social](https://matrix.to/#/#haveno-development:monero.social) relayed on IRC/Libera (`#haveno-development`)

Below is a list of fiat payment methods Haveno currently supports.

!!! note
    The maximum trade sizes listed below are not available for most newly-created payment accounts. Please refer to Account signing for details on how to enable larger trade sizes for your payment accounts.
