# Revolut

Revolut offers banking services in [various countries](https://www.revolut.com/help/getting-started/verifying-identity/what-countries-are-supported) with [various currencies](https://www.revolut.com/help/getting-started/adding-money-to-revolut). It is most heavily used in the EUR market, but has seen action in other markets increase as Revolut has expanded the markets it operates, representing a good chance for international payments and USD payments. Due to recurring issues with other banks, it's not possible to add a Revolut SEPA account or use it as "faster payments" at Haveno. This payment method is only for transfers between Revolut users.

#### 1. Creating the account in Haveno

To create a Revolut payment account in Haveno, you need to input the country for your Revolut account, your revolut username, and the currencies that you wish to trade with the account.

Remember that none of this information can be modified once an account is created, and [account signing](../account_limits.md/#account-signing) data can be lost if not [properly backed up](../../haveno-ui/backup_and_restore.md/#2-back-up-payment-accounts). If you edit your username, a new Haveno account should have to be created, unsigned and with 3 XMR trading limits.

#### 2. Revolut username

On the bottom of your Revolut app, tap the two arrows symbol in the middle. Then, under your real name, there's a `@username`. This is what should go into your account details, and what you should use to make a Revolut payment. **Usernames are case-sensitive.**

#### 3. Pay to username

Revolut calls usernames "Revtags", and has a help center article called [How can I send money by Revtag?](https://help.revolut.com/help/transfers/internal-transfers/username-payments/how-can-i-send-money-by-username) which explains how to send money to one. If that doesn't work, see [Why can’t I pay someone by Revtag?](https://help.revolut.com/help/transfers/internal-transfers/username-payments/why-cant-i-pay-someone-by-username) and make sure that "Payments with friends" is enabled.
