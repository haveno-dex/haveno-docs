# Publishers

Haveno publishers take care of the "live" app and release the binaries to the public. They are completely independent from the Haveno Core team. A summary of their tasks is:

- They release the binaries (software) to the public
- They set the initial seednodes that users will use to bootstrap the network
- They provide Monero nodes for users to connect to, to boost performances
- They determine trade fees and how they are collected
- They appoint [arbitrators](arbitrators.md)
