# Arbitrators

Arbitrators are the key of [dispute resolution](../dispute-resolution.md) in Haveno. They are the entity that holds the third key of each trade so that they can intervene and unlock a trade when summoned.

## The work of the arbitrator

An arbitrator will run an Haveno instance and will stay available to traders. When called, they will evaluate the complaints and, after making the appropriate investigation, will decide which part is in the right and which part is in the wrong and will award escrowed funds accordingly.
