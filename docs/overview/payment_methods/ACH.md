#### Is ACH Transfer a payment method that can be signed?

#### How do I set up a ACH Transfer account?

Please note that not all banks offer ACH transfers to third parties. It's crucial to verify if your bank supports this service. Most banks allow ACH transfers to accounts you own at other institutions. However, they may ask you to confirm two micro-deposits they initiate. This process is not the same as a third-party transfer and Haveno sellers usually won't confirm these micro-deposits. Confirming micro-deposits enables your bank to send and receive money from that account, but this isn't a third-party transfer. If your bank fully supports third-party ACH transfers, they won't ask for micro-deposit verification. ACH transfers are typically provided at a low cost, so be sure to check with your bank about any fees.
